Beginning
You are standing at the end of a road before a dark and dank cave.
The forest is covering the road lending a dark and
spooky aspect to the road. You hear a low wailing that seems to be coming from the cave.
(I recommend the going to room 2)

Facing your 1st Challenge (I think)
You walk into a room and you see... A OGRE! (Not the Shrek-type, I mean
the myth-accurate, smelly, nasty, mean, and ugly as-you-know-what type ogre)
You reach for your weapon... but you realize you don't have one!!!
What should you do?? Fight or flight?
